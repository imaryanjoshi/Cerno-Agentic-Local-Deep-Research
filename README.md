Cerno is an open-source workspace for conducting **deep**, **multi-step** research and analysis using autonomous AI agents. Designed for developers and researchers who demand **analytical transparency**, Cerno exposes every reasoning step—from prompt decomposition to final synthesis—so you can observe, debug, and steer complex agentic workflows with confidence.

## 🚀 Highlights

* **Model-Agnostic Core**: Effortlessly switch between premier LLMs (OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, DeepSeek) or run local models via Ollama.
* **Zero-Config Setup**: One CLI, one command—automatically create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and configure your workspace.
* **Transparent Execution Plan**: Visualize each agent task as it moves through Pending → Running → Success/Error states in real time.
* **Verifiable Artifacts**: Every source, webpage, and generated file (reports, code, data) is tracked and organized for easy auditing.
* **Adaptive Depth**: Simple queries spawn lightweight plans; complex directives trigger multi-agent, multi-tool orchestrations.
* **Token & Cost Optimization**: A manager-worker agent architecture balances quality and cost. Get a complete cost breakdown upon task completion.
* **Local-First Ethos**: Work offline, retain full control of your data, and avoid vendor lock-in. Cerno’s local-first architecture ensures your research stays where you want it: on your machine.

## 🌱 Local-First Principles

Cerno embraces a **local-first** philosophy:

1. **Data Sovereignty**: All research artifacts—notes, reports, intermediate files—live on your local drive by default.
2. **Offline Capability**: Core features work without internet. Use local LLMs (via Ollama) for research when connectivity is limited.
3. **Privacy & Security**: Sensitive prompts and outputs never leave your machine unless explicitly configured.
4. **Interoperability**: Write, export, and share results in standard formats (Markdown, Jupyter notebooks, JSON) without proprietary lock-in.

## 🛡️ Active Development & Community

Cerno is under **active development**—we’re constantly pushing new features, performance optimizations, and integrations. Your feedback is invaluable:

* **Bug Reports**: Found an issue? Please open an issue on GitHub with detailed steps to reproduce.
* **Feature Requests**: Have a great idea? Share it as an issue or discussion ticket.
* **Contributions**: We welcome pull requests! See our [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on setting up your dev environment, coding standards, and how to submit changes.

Let’s build something amazing together! 🚀

## 📦 Prerequisites

* **Python** ≥ 3.10
* **Node.js** ≥ 18.x & **npm**

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local CLI)

1. **Clone the repo** (or download the repo)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/divagr18/Cerno-Agentic-Local-Deep-Research.git
   cd Cerno-Agentic-Local-Deep-Research
   ```

2. **Run Migrations**

   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   chmod +x cerno
   ./cerno migrate
   #for detailed logs
   ./cerno migrate --verbose  

   # Windows
   .\cerno migrate
   #for detailed logs
   .\cerno migrate --verbose
   ```

3. **Post-Migration Setup**

After applying migrations, follow these steps to configure your environment and launch Cerno:

1. **Copy the `.env` template**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Creates a fresh `.env` file. Open it and fill in your API keys (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`) or local model settings for Ollama. 

   For now, we only support OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, Deepseek and local models on Ollama **that support tool calling**, but support for more models is coming in the next release.


2. **Activate the virtual environment**

   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows PowerShell/CMD  
   source venv/bin/activate    # macOS/Linux
   ```

   Ensures that Cerno’s dependencies and CLI are available in your current shell.

3. **Start Cerno**

   ```bash
   cerno start
   ```

   Launches both the Django backend and the React frontend. Once running, open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

4. **List all commands**

   ```bash
   cerno --help
   ```

   Displays all available CLI commands and options.

---

## 🐳 Docker Installation

Prefer containerized workflows? Follow these steps:

1. Clone and set up `.env` as above.
2. Build and launch with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
