## Introduction

Cerno is designed to make complex research tasks easier and more efficient. It leverages agentic AI to break down intricate queries into manageable, verifiable workflows. With Cerno, you can switch between cloud-based large language models (LLMs) and self-hosted models effortlessly. This flexibility allows you to track each step of your reasoning, optimize costs, and manage tokens‚Äîall while ensuring your data remains on your machine.
